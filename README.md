### Hi there 
---

Iâ€™ve worked on a number of production apps with some amazing teams in Agile-like, CI/CD environments. Most of my experience is building things with JavaScript FE frameworks/libraries like React and Vue, and styling them with CSS/Sass. My contributions have included new features, bug fixes, style refactors, accessibility updates, dependency and version updates, unit tests, internationalization, and documentation.

But I like to think that the most valuable asset I bring to the table is an optimistic and encouraging attitude. What fuels this positive temperament? Iâ€™m a bit of a people-pleaser. I really donâ€™t like conflict. I hate it when others feel bad. And history has proven time and again that when thereâ€™s a problem or weâ€™re in the weeds or the sprint is bearing down, a friendly smile and a dash of good cheer bear more fruit than getting upset or frustrated. 

So, whether your team is building something new, maintaining or updating something old, or just tackling tech debt, reach out. Iâ€™m happy to help. Best wishes!

### Hi there 
---

I’ve worked on a number of production apps with some amazing teams in Agile-like environments. My contributions have included new features, bug fixes, style refactors, accessibility updates, dependency and version updates, unit tests, internationalization, and documentation.

But I like to think that the most valuable asset I bring to the table is an optimistic and encouraging attitude. What fuels this positive temperament? I’m a bit of a people-pleaser. I really don’t like conflict. I hate it when others feel bad. And when there’s a problem or we’re in the weeds or the sprint is bearing down, getting upset or frustrated only makes things worse. But a friendly smile and a dash of good cheer can really go a long way in the other direction. 

So, whether your team is building something new, maintaining or updating something old, or just tackling tech debt, reach out. I’m happy to help.

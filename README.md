### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ˜„ About Me:
---

I started playing around with web development back in 2014. Fell in love with it right away. Studied for a couple years and landed myself a small contract role as a mentor at an online coding bootcamp in March of 2016. Been working and growing in this industry ever since. Most recently as a Frontend React Developer for a mid-size firm building enormous applications for large corporate clients.

I'm the ultimate team player. And my positive friendly attitude is good for morale. I prefer to take my time to try to get things right the first time. And I take pride in my work and the hope that I'm making things better along the way.

And when I'm not working, I love to learn new things and spend time with my family. I love to watch movies and play the guitar and play video games with my kids. I love the outdoors, but don't get out there as much as I should. I love to read and build things. And whenever possible, I love to ponder the meaning of life, the nature of reality, the essence of truth, the mystery of consciousness, and the clockworks of the human condition.

### Greetings!
---

Iâ€™ve worked on a number of production applications with some amazing, diverse and remote teams in Agile-like, CI/CD environments. Some of those projects live on web apps for XBOX, Hydro Flask and Leatherman, among others. Most of my experience is building things with JavaScript FE libraries like React and Vue, and styling them with CSS/Sass. But I have worked with Backend and database technologies as well. My contributions have included new features, bug fixes, style refactors, accessibility updates, dependency and version updates, unit tests, internationalization, and documentation.

But perhaps the most valuable asset I bring is an optimistic and encouraging attitude. What fuels this positive temperament? Iâ€™m a bit of a people-pleaser. I dislike conflict and when others feel bad. And a friendly smile and good cheer tend to get better results than the alternative. 

So, whether your team is building something new, maintaining or updating something old, or just tackling tech debt, reach out. Iâ€™m happy to help. Best wishes!
